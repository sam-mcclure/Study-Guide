2. What is localStorage? How might you use it?
- Local storage is HTML5's ability to store data on the client side browser, allowing you to retain the state of an application, cache data, or store user preferences

3. Why are media queries useful?
- You can tailor an application so it uses the space available to it, ie make things larger on mobile devices and smaller and spaced out on desktops

4. What is mobile-first design? Be as specific as possible.
- Designing for mobile devices before designing for desktop or other devices. This will make the page display faster on smaller devices. Instead of changing styles when the width gets smaller, we should change when the width gets larger
